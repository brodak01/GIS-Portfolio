# GIS-Portfolio
This page displays my work I completed in Advanced GIS at Carnegie Mellon University.

# About Me

My name is Jonathan Brodak, and I am a second year MSPPM student.

# What I hope to learn

I am excited to flesh out my GIS skills and learn more about more advanced actions in GIS. I enjoyed my Intro to GIS course, so I'm excited to continue learning about new skills in GIS! I also would like to work on a really nice map that I can use as an example of my work for interviews.

# Portfolio

Here is where my map links will go.
