# About Me

My name is Jonathan Brodak, and I use he/him pronouns. I am a native of Southwestern Pennsylvania, being born in the small town of Carmichaels and growing up in Washington, PA, which is a suburb of Pittsburgh. I graduated from Allegheny College with my Bachelor's in History with a minor in Biology, and I am currently a Master's student at Carnegie Mellon University studying Public Policy and Management.

I live in the city of Pittsburgh with my two kittens: Poppy and Haku! I've never cared for cats before, so it has been a new and exciting experience for me. Feel free to ask me for pictures of them!

I have multiple hobbies that I try my best to balance. I enjoy jogging and hiking for exercise. You can often find me jogging through Schenley Park in the morning! I love baking bread, my favorite is the French Boule. I've been learning how to cultivate and bake Sourdough, but my first two attempts haven't been successful just yet! I love exploring new countries! So far, I've visited 14 countries in the world, my most recent trip being to Vancouver in January 2025!

# What I hope to learn

I am excited to flesh out my GIS skills and learn more about more advanced actions in GIS. I enjoyed my Intro to GIS course, so I'm excited to continue learning about new skills in GIS! I also would like to work on a really nice map that I can use as an example of my work for interviews.
